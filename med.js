/**
 * 
 * 4. Create a Javascript function that computes the cost of renting a car. The function asks the user to input his age, the size of the car he wants and the number days he will rent the car, and then outputs the cost.
 * 
 *  To compute the cost, first, you need to calculate the car rental cost for one day based on the size of the car: economy, medium, or full-size, and based on the userâ€™s age. Here is how to get the one day cost of renting a car. The base charge is $50. There is a surcharge of $10 if the driver is under 25 and an additional surcharge based on the car size:
 * car size      		surcharge
 *  economy                        $0 
 *  medium                         $10
 *   full-size                         $15
 *  
 * Then you need to multiply the one day cost by the number of days the car is rented in order to get the full cost.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * insurance(18, "medium", 7)
 * 
 * ==> 910
 * 
 * insurance(30,"full-size",30)
 *  ==> 15000
 *
